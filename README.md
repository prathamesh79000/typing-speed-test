Typing Speed Test

The Typing Speed Test application created using Python is designed to measure a user's typing speed and accuracy. It provides an interactive environment for users to practice and improve their typing skills. Here is a general description of the application's features and functionality:

User Interface: The application has a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides a clean and user-friendly environment for typing practice. The GUI displays the text to be typed and provides a text input field for users to enter their typed text.

Randomized Text: The application generates random sentences or paragraphs for the user to type. This ensures that the typing test is different each time, offering varied content for practice.

Timer: The application includes a timer that starts counting as soon as the user begins typing. This allows users to track their typing speed by measuring the time taken to complete the typing exercise.

Accuracy Calculation: The application compares the user's typed text with the original text and calculates the accuracy percentage based on the number of correct keystrokes. It considers factors such as incorrect characters, missed characters, and extra characters.

Words per Minute (WPM) Calculation: The application calculates the user's typing speed in words per minute. It uses the total time taken to type the text and the average length of words in the text to calculate the WPM score.

Results Display: Once the user completes the typing exercise, the application provides a summary of the results. This includes the time taken, accuracy percentage, and WPM score.
